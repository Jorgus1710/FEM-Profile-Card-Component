## My process

Mobile first approach as always. Taking a moment to formulate HTML structure in my head before putting it in code.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to use position absolute and relative to manipulate an image. I also learned to use multiple background images, linking them in CSS. I also learned to force the position and manipulate the size of these images by playing with the background-position style.
